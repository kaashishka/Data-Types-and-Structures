This structure allows for efficient retrieval of values based on their associated keys. Here's a breakdown of how it works:\n","1.\tKey-Value Pairs: Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs. Each key is unique and immutable (meaning it cannot be changed after creation). Values, on the other hand, can be of any data type and can be duplicated.\n","2.\tHashing: When a key-value pair is added to a dictionary, the key is passed through a hash function. This function generates a hash value, which is an integer that acts as an index into an array (the hash table).\n","3.\tStorage in the Hash Table: The hash value determines the location (or \"bucket\") in the hash table where the value will be stored. Ideally, each key maps to a unique bucket. However, different keys can sometimes produce the same hash value, a situation known as a collision.\n","4.\tCollision Handling: Various techniques are employed to handle collisions\n","Retrieval: To retrieve a value, Python again hashes the key and uses the hash value to locate the bucket in the hash table. If the bucket contains multiple values (due to a collision), additional checks (using the original key) are performed to retrieve the correct value.\n","\n","Ques 5: Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","- Ans: Because sets cannot have multiple occurrences of the same element, it makes sets highly useful to efficiently remove duplicate values from a list or tuple and to perform common math operations like unions and intersections.\n","\n","Ques 6: What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list\n","- Ans: A string is a sequence of characters between single or double quotes.\n","\n","Ques 7: How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","- Ans: Tuples in Python ensure data integrity through their immutability. This means that once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.\n","\n","Ques 8: What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","- Ans: A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an associative manner, using key-value pairs. It employs a hash function to compute an index (or hash code) from each key. This index determines where the corresponding value is stored within the hash table's underlying array. This allows for efficient retrieval of values given their associated keys.\n","\n","Ques 9: Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n","-Ans: Yes, lists can contain heterogeneous data types and objects. For instance, integers, strings, and even functions can be stored within the same list.\n","\n","Ques 10: Explain why strings are immutable in Python.\n","- Ans: Strings in Python are “immutable” which means they can not be changed after they are created. Some other immutable data types are integers, float, boolean, etc.\n","\n","The immutability of Python string is very useful as it helps in hashing, performance optimization, safety, ease of use, etc.\n","\n","Ques 11:  What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","- Ans: Dictionaries provide faster lookups compared to lists when searching by key.\n","\n","Ques 12:  Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list.\n","\n","- Ans: Storing a record of a point in 2D space is a great example of when to use a tuple instead of a list. A point, defined by its x and y coordinates, is inherently fixed. Once the point is defined, its coordinates generally shouldn't change. Using a tuple ensures that the point's data remains constant, preserving its integrity. For instance, if you're performing geometric calculations, using tuples for your points prevents accidental modification, guaranteeing the accuracy and consistency of your results.\n","\n","Ques 13: How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","- Ans: Sets in Python are fundamentally designed to store only unique elements. When you attempt to add a duplicate value to a set, Python simply ignores the addition, and the set remains unchanged. It doesn't raise an error; the duplicate is silently discarded. This behavior is a core feature of sets and is what makes them useful for tasks like removing duplicates from a list or ensuring that all elements in a collection are unique.\n","\n","Ques 14: How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries\n","- Ans: The in keyword operates differently for lists (Linear search, Time complexity) and for dictionaries (Hash table lookup,Time complexity,Checks only keys).\n","\n","Ques 15: Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","- Ans: No, you cannot directly modify the elements of a tuple in Python. Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. Attempting to do so will result in a TypeError.\n","\n","\n","Ques 16: What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?\n","- Ans: A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. This allows for representing hierarchical or multi-layered data structures\n","\n","\n","Ques 17: Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n","- Ans: Most common dictionary operations like retrieving by key, checking key existence, updates, and deletions have an average time complexity of O(1), making them extremely efficient. However, it's crucial to be aware of the theoretical worst-case O(n) scenario due to hash collisions, even though it's unlikely to occur in practice with Python's well-optimized implementation. Iterating and copying a dictionary always have a time complexity of O(n).\n","\n","Ques 18: In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","- Ans: while dictionaries excel at fast key-based lookups and are generally preferred for associative data, lists are more suitable when order preservation, handling duplicates, or frequent index-based access is paramount. Consider the specific requirements of your task to choose the most appropriate data structure.\n","\n","Ques 19: Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","- Ans: A dictionary is termed an unordered collection of objects because dictionaries do not maintain any inherent order of the items based on when they were added.\n","\n","Ques 20: Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval.\n","- Ans: Lists and dictionaries in Python differ significantly in how they store and retrieve data, leading to different performance characteristics and use cases.\n","\n","Lists:\n","Ordered collections:\n","Index-based retrieval:\n","Sequential access:\n","Duplicate values allowed:\n","Key-value pairs:\n","Key-based retrieval:\n","\n","Dictionaries use a hash table implementation, allowing for very fast average-case retrieval (O(1) time complexity). The key is hashed to determine the memory location of the value.\n","Dictionaries originally did not maintain any specific order of elements.\n","\n","No duplicate
